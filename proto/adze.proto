// ADZE core concept representations standard representation formats for:
// peers and content scores.
//  all timestamps are 64 bit ints, representing milliseconds since unix epoch

// Everything roles up into this single object, the Manifest.  An ADZE manifest
// should contain all the data necessary to do local ranking of content.  All
// the content i adze to my list ends up in my manifest. I can publish my 
// manifest for anyone to consume it. 

// I can also add other adze users' manifests. The ADZE client (browser plugin
// or otherwise) can download all of my peer's manifests, and show me content
// my peers like. We can add in recursion if we want as well: my client
// might decide to 'follow' peers lists several hops out.

// Once there's enough content on here, we can start experimenting with ranking
// options. People can rank the content however they want. Some might sort by 
// new, others might build ML models, etc.  Those custom rankings and sort
// orders can themselves be represnted by public manifests, so people can
// experiment easily.

// Since all content that's added is added _by some person_, we can filter spam 
// just by not adding those spammy peers to our own manifests. Of course, we'll
// differ in our judgement there, but that's the whole point of ADZE.
