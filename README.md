# ADZE: Aggressively Decentralized Search Engine
#### Or: ADZE: Asynchronous Digital Sharing Environment

# Reinvent the magic of the web with just the right primtives

In a nutshell, adze is a **Relevance Protocol**.

Adze (sounds like 'ads') is a protocol that rides on top of HTTP. Adze peers exchange information about quality content, using "recursive lists of rated links."  Users will store lists of links they have opinions on, at publicly accessible urls. These lists can also include links to other peer's adze lists.   By recursively crawling the lists of rated links, adze peers will be able get a list of high quality links, on their local machine.  Adze peers can choose which other peers they think have good quality links, and will get the content of those users' peer lists as well.

The result is something like an easily hackable, totally decentralized link-sharing network, which, in the limit of many many people using adze, could evolve into a decentralized search engine.

# How do I use this?
* install the browser plugin located here - you'll need to 'load an unpacked extension' (working on getting approval from google to add it to the chrome marketplace)
* use the plugin to 'adze' sites that you like, by clicking the button the extension adds to your browser:

 ![Adze icon](https://i.imgur.com/qJb9YAm.png)
* the plugin will publish a list of the links you've rated, on the web where others can see it. You'll need to configure it first.
* right click that icon to pull up an 'options' page, and add a github user auth token on the 'setup' tab

* this will give you a url which contains a list of links you like. share this with your friends, especially me.
* 'adze' your friends' links in the 'my peers' tab of the plugin's options page
* use the 'feed' page in the options page to consume the content of yours

Soon it will consume content from your friends' of friends lists, and those friends' lists, and those friend's lists, etc

The goal is to make create a network of revalance signals, exchanged among peers who trust each other, so that we can eventually index everything worth indexing on the web. As new links are added by peers, they'll show up in your feed. We are in the stage of 'seeding the network' right now.  Think of yourself as an early pioneer in what may be a very exciting future of the web. Make the web weird again!
